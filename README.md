How has Covid-19 affected Australia’s tourism industry? & Are we ultimately on our way back to 'Normal'? 

We predict that the tourism industry’s economy to be directly affected by the amount of travellers in and out of the country, and believe we will find correlations that describe this in our data.

Areas of research:
Employment amount and economic output between the tourism sub-industries
Interstate arrivals
Arrivals by visa type/reason for travel
Arrivals by stay duration

This data can teach us how an economic industry works by finding correspondences between multiple different pieces of data, understand how the tourism industry as well as the overall economy is recovering post-Covid, whether the flow of arrivals and departures is much less or similar to pre-Covid in conjunction with visa types and reasons for travel 

Overall, we found that; 

During the pandemic, border closures and lockdowns had significant effects on travel, big dips evident in data, reflective of lockdowns, this varied state to state depending on lockdown restrictions and border closure durations. Arrivals into Australia in 2022 have already surpassed total arrivals into 2021 therefore can infer arrivals can continue to increase towards pre covid values. 

Hospitality is highest employer in tourism sub-industries; Air, Water and Other Transport highest earning sub-industry. The percentage of change between 2019 to 2021 of employment within national tourism decreases by 15.59%, and for monetary output by 49.26%. As of Dec-2021, Total economy filled jobs is back on track, confirmed by regression line, although tourism is still catching up we don’t have enough data to see the recovery of monetary output. 

Biggest resurgence in arrivals has been in those with Special Category Visas (from New Zealand as well as in visitors. We are still yet to see an increase in arrivals with Work or Skilled Visas. A large resurgence is present in those visiting Family with low number of short term arrivals for less than 1 month. 

Ultimately it is also important to consider we cannot completely conclude changes in numbers are completely due to COVID, secondry effects occuring at the time may have had an effect (e.g. elections, wars, etc.)
